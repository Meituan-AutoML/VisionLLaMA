# Benchmark and Model Zoo

## Common settings

- We use distributed training with 4 GPUs by default.

- All pytorch-style pretrained backbones on ImageNet are train by ourselves, with the same procedure in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01187.pdf).
  Our ResNet style backbone are based on ResNetV1c variant, where the 7x7 conv in the input stem is replaced with three 3x3 convs.

- For the consistency across different hardwares, we report the GPU memory as the maximum value of `torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated()` for all 4 GPUs with `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark=False`.
  Note that this value is usually less than what `nvidia-smi` shows.

- We report the inference time as the total time of network forwarding and post-processing, excluding the data loading time.
  Results are obtained with the script `tools/benchmark.py` which computes the average time on 200 images with `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark=False`.

- There are two inference modes in this framework.

  - `slide` mode: The `test_cfg` will be like `dict(mode='slide', crop_size=(769, 769), stride=(513, 513))`.

    In this mode, multiple patches will be cropped from input image, passed into network individually.
    The crop size and stride between patches are specified by `crop_size` and `stride`.
    The overlapping area will be merged by average

  - `whole` mode: The `test_cfg` will be like `dict(mode='whole')`.

    In this mode, the whole imaged will be passed into network directly.

    By default, we use `slide` inference for 769x769 trained model, `whole` inference for the rest.

- For input size of 8x+1 (e.g. 769), `align_corner=True` is adopted as a traditional practice.
  Otherwise, for input size of 8x (e.g. 512, 1024), `align_corner=False` is adopted.
